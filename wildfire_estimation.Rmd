```{r}
library(ggplot2)

#importing in data
fires <- read.csv('https://people.carleton.edu/~apoppick/ClassData/CA_fires',header = TRUE)


#Defining our dataset of interest
Y<-fires$GIS_ACRES

n<-length(Y)

y_m <- 5e4



#Generating our chosen estimate from the simulation
alpha_hat_MLE <- 1/mean(log(Y/y_m)) #MLE Formula
#Generating our chosen confidence interval from the simulation
exact.lower <- alpha_hat_MLE*qgamma(0.025, n, n)
exact.upper <- alpha_hat_MLE*qgamma(0.975, n, n)

#Output
cat("Thus our estimate of alpha is ", alpha_hat_MLE, "With a 95% confidence interval (", exact.lower,"," ,exact.upper,")" )

#Then using our alpha  to set up a pareto distribution and sampling it a large number of times
X <- rexp(100000, rate = alpha_hat_MLE)
expected_dist <- y_m * exp(X) # Y ~ Pareto(y_m, alpha)

#Getting quantiles corresponding to each point in fires 
repquantiles<-c(1/((n+1)/(1:n)))
#Getting values corresponding to those quantiles
repvalues<-quantile(expected_dist, repquantiles)

#Generating a qq plot for them
qqplot(Y/1000, repvalues/1000, xlab = "Wildfire Size (1000 acres)", ylab = "Expected Value at Quantile (1000 Acres) ")

```

Our goal is to then get the expected number of fires per year:


```{r}
#Expected Rate from Assignment
expected_rate = 9
#Upper Value of Interest
upperval<-3e5
#Output From
cat("This gives us an estimated number of fires over 300,000 acres as between ", expected_rate*(y_m/upperval)**exact.upper, "and ", expected_rate*(y_m/upperval)**exact.lower, "fires per year")
```
